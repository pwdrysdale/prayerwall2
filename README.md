# Prayer Wall 2 - A Rebuild

## Motivation

I build the prayer wall some time ago using a pretty basic express server. Now I want to upgrade it, and have it as a bit of a running project, taking into consideration new bits and pieces that I have learnt and continue to learn.

Additionally, I want to showcase what I know and build and be open to feedback on it. In some ways being 'self taught'

## Summary of Technologies / Methodologies

### Backend

-   Apollo-Server-Express (GraphQL)
-   Postgres
-   TypeOrm
-   TypeGraphQL

I would like to move this to a microservice architecture as I learn more about those (currently can survive Docker), and make use of S3 for some of the heavier file lifting

### Frontend

-   React
-   Zustand (first time using it, whilst GQL handles alot of the state, there are still things like toasts that I want to use more)
-   CSS Modules

I would also like to start using Storybooks or similar to start to modulate some front end code a little better

### Skills To Practice Here

-   Typescript in general (just completed @JHerr's NOBSTS course)
